Windows
-------

1. Run the setup.exe

The setup is not currently signed:

On Windows 8.1 you may not see the installer dialog appear for a long time, you may need to 
temporarily disable antivirus (e.g. windows defender) to allow it.

On Windows 8.1 and Windows 10, SmartScreen may warn you and attempt to block it, you should allow
it to be installed.

Please feel free to virus scan it and check it with your spyware tools before installing.
The application or it's files should not contain any viruses. Do not install if it any are 
identified.

2. When you run Arnold, go to Tools->File Associations. Do Select All and apply. 
Uncheck "Make Arnold the default emulator" if you don't want it to override your existing
file associations. Files can still be opened by right clicking and doing "Open With Arnold".

Mac
---

1. Open the DMG file
2. Drag and drop the icon into your applications

Arnold is now installed.

Linux
-----

Currently you will need to build the executable. You can then run it directly from the
executable directory. Arnold doesn't need to be installed.

File associations can be setup using the shell script in the linux directory.

A rpm/deb package is planned.
