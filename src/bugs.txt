Mac port bugs:
- joystick works???
- keyjoy clashes with keyboard regardless of keyjoy block. need to fix that 
better.
- joystick dialog and csd dialog do not layout correctly
- speed of emulator can't be controlled.
- sometimes menus do not respond
- under virtual box it's slow.
- pressing f11/f12 in debugger defaults to mac behaviour and makes window fullscreen
consider using mac defaults or block it somehow
- crashes on exit - fixed.

- remove disc while it's reading it -> crash

- http://scratchpad.wikia.com/wiki/Spectrum_emulator_file_formats implement support for hdf

other list:
- victory road rotate joystick
- digital joysticks on cpc+ cause no clash? done
- analogue joystick code
- control select boxworld
- vertical hardware scroll code
- horizontal scrolling code
- tilemap scroll

Break emulator on vbl, hbl, interrupt, disc access etc.
instruction timing breakpoint thing?
 
Run .bin/.bas by injecting them into a disk image and running it.

 

Currently "inject to ram" is used.

Interrupt mode 2 test putting stack where int vector is to see if push is done before int table read or not.

Restore address after. ;)
 

Consider tape/disc patches like original a-cpc?
In stack window show memory opcodes from address??

MAC:
- from beginning sdl window has focus
clicking on other window looses focus and it's not regained again.
- find a good way to make sdl1 work with mac 
- sdl2 seems to work ok but doesn't embed window.


to test:
- ppi clear vsync when crtc sets it
- interrupt counter cpc and kcc; must vsync be active at the same time we see each hsync for reset to happen?
- make
